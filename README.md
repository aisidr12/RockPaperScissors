# RockPaperScissors

This is a Lottoland Challenge.

Backend developed with JAVA 8- Git.
Inside of the main branch which is Master you install the project with mvn clean install to download some dependencies. I tried to use few dependencies.
we develop Junit test for the services.
 
 The main endpoint is : http://localhost:8080/RockPaperScissors/
 
 Inside the project we save a postman collection in order to test it with postman.
 Also this works with Swagger: 
 
 http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#/game-controller , which is more detailed all the endpoints. All exceptions are controlled but for next version we will send and errorCode and message in order to show to the view.
